        Welcome to this experiment!
        </h3>
        <br/>
        We are researchers from the University of Innsbruck and Luxembourg who are interested in asset market behavior.
        However, all data collected will be anonymized, not passed on to third parties, and only used for scientific research purposes.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Throughout the experiment you are grouped with 5 other participants. This group of 6 will do two tasks where you
        interact and where your actions influence the outcomes of the other group members. <b> To make this experiment a
        success, please finish the experiment in its entirety and do not drop out prematurely. In case you drop out
        prematurely, you might also hinder other participants from completing the experiment.</b>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Information on your payoff will be shown on a separate screen and you will receive your payoff  in the upcoming
        6 weeks via bank transfer. For this we collect your bank credentials, i.e. name of account holder and IBAN, at the end of the experiment. This data
        will be stored in a separate database and no choices from the experiment can be connected to them.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        If you want to continue please click on <i>I agree and want to participate</i>. If not, please click <i>I disagree and do
        not want to participate</i>. In this case you are forwarded to the end of the experiment, no data will be collected
        and you will not receive any payoff.
