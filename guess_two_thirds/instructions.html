        Task 1: Pick a number
    </h3>

        <p>
            As a first task you should try to predict ⅔ of the average of numbers between 0 and 100 picked by the whole
            group. Everybody will individually pick a number between 0 and 100.
            The average of the {{ C.PLAYERS_PER_GROUP }} numbers picked by the {{ C.PLAYERS_PER_GROUP }} group members is calculated
            (the sum of the {{ C.PLAYERS_PER_GROUP }} numbers is divided by {{ C.PLAYERS_PER_GROUP }}).
        </p>

        <p>
            Everybody gets
            {{C.ENDOWMENT_UPCOMING_APP}} Euros for his/her pick,
            and whoever is closest to ⅔ of the average gets a bonus payment of an additional {{C.JACKPOT}} Euros at the
            end of the experiment. In the case of a tie, the bonus payment will be split equally.
        </p>

        <p>
            The information whether
            you have won the additional payment or not you will see at the end of the experiment.
        </p>
